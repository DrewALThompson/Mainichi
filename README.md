Simple little SPA JS(React-Redux) and Rails Project meant to aim towards studying Language Proficiency Tests. Proof of concept that certainly could be refactored and most likely will be in the near future!

If you want to run and test this file, simply fork it and cd into mainichi-backend and run Rails s. All the current build is located in the public folder. If you wish to edit and test something, cd back into mainichi(lowercase is important) change the JS/HTML and then npm run build. Copy the build, paste into the mainichi-backend public folder(might have to delete the previous files) and Rails s again. If I could, and maybe I will do this, I would maybe use Xpress or Mongo.
